							<h3 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold font-italic">Quality Coffee Cultivated by<br>Good</h3>
							<p class="paragraph-text">A simple statement, but one that means a lot to us. <i>Quality Coffee Cultivated by Good</i> is the belief that coffee only tastes good when it’s made ethically and with care. It’s the simple truth our business is built on.</p><br>

							<p class="paragraph-text">It all begins with our partners at origin. Quality coffee can only be cultivated with time, care and commitment – there are no short-cuts here. We go right to the source. No middle men. We meet the producers. We get to know them, their families and communities. We see for ourselves how the money is benefiting the communities and being reinvested back in to the farms.</p><br>

							<p class="paragraph-text">We're proud of our long-lasting partnerships with the best producers in the business. Our team spends a lot of time on the ground at origin, in some of the most remote places in the world. We're looking at the latest harvest, tasting, roasting and working with our partners to find new ways to deliver a better crop than the one before.</p><br>

							<p class="paragraph-text">For us, this is the ultimate win-win. With better crops, our producers receive higher prices, which means greater investment into their communities. And for us, it means we can continue to enjoy the highest quality coffee possible. We see our coffee being grown sustainably, with the future in mind and positively impacting the livelihoods of coffee farmers. This way of business will always be a non-negotiable for us.</p><br>


							<p class="paragraph-text">Our local cafe partnerships are just as important.  Built on the same long-lasting respect and mutual trust, our partners are selected based on their shared devotion to quality. It's vital this standard of quality is upheld with every Campos Coffee served. We're very proud to offer our support and services beyond beans. We have a wealth of experience and knowledge that we're always keen to share with our cafe partners – from setting up cafes, to growing their business and even opening additional cafes. Ultimately, we want to support our local partners in living a happy, healthy and rewarding life in coffee. Much the same as we wish for our partners at origin.</p><br>


							<p class="paragraph-text">Let's not forget bringing good to the world can only happen through amazing people. Our tenacious and passionate coffee lovers at Campos work tirelessly to guarantee we deliver on our promise of Quality Coffee Cultivated by Good, in everything we do.  And for the coffee drinker, the satisfaction isn't just in the great taste, it's in knowing every little cup is doing good in the world.</p><br>

						<p class="paragraph-text">For us, good ethics means more than just avoiding bad practice. It means actively supporting good practice and helping improve education and living standards of all the communities we work with. After all, we don't just aim for fair trade. We want the communities behind the coffee we drink every day, to prosper and thrive.</p><br>

						<h3 class="text-uppercase text-center font-weight-bold font-italic">SPECIALTY COFFEE BY DEFINITION,<br>MEANS NO ORDINARY BEAN CAN MAKE<br>THE GRADE.</h3>
						<p class="paragraph-text"><i>Credit where credit is due, our partners work hard to cultivate only the best coffee beans.</i></p><br>

						<p class="paragraph-text">To guarantee our beans are at their flavourful best, the cherries are handpicked, but only when they're perfectly ripe. This allows their natural characteristics to blossom and be preserved. We don't believe sub-standard beans should ever exist, especially not hidden away in our specialty coffee blends. We pride ourselves on the fact that we only ever use specialty grade beans in our coffee. This includes all of our blends, all of our single origins and of course, our flagship Superior Blend. And this will never change.</p><br>

						<p class="paragraph-text">Once the beans make it into the hands of our expert roasters, it's time to really bring out the quality in flavour. We spend a great deal of time roasting, testing, cupping and assessing the beans to ensure every roast has the right balance and flavour profiles shining through. We repeat this process again and again, until we’re convinced it's just right, each and every time. And even after this rigorous process, we still cup every morning – without fail. Years on, it remains our favourite part of the day. The morning just wouldn't be right without it.</p><br>

						<p class="paragraph-text">On his first visit to a coffee growing origin, he had his second epiphany. It was there he saw the power and immense potential that coffee had to transform lives and communities. What started as a delicious cup of coffee in Newtown was now a heartfelt mission to create more good in the world.</p><br>

						<p class="paragraph-text">Fast forward to today – and many cups of coffee later – we now have 7 flagship Campos Coffee cafes, roasteries in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, and an amazing network of partner cafes across Australia. We have at least one social project in each region we buy from. We've built a school building in Papua New Guinea. We've purchased a large tractor for a coffee farming co-op in Kenya and built hundreds of drying beds. We’ve been major funders in Open Heart – a program that sends Australian heart surgeons to Rwanda to perform lifesaving operations on children that would otherwise have no access to cardio vascular specialists. We are major supporters of a school building project in Ethiopia to house 1000 students and a school library in El Salvador. And these are just some of the many social projects we’re proud to have played a part in with the Campos Coffee history.</p><br>
